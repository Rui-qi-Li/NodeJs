# Blog website Project 

*This is a project for CS353C Software Design module, which will keep updating during the whole semester 

This is a simple blog built on a local server and run on Node.js for the server side language. Express is required to handle the requests from browsers, Google firebase is used for the real-time database and authentication system, jQuery library is embedded to process the browser's behaviour, templates and Ajax function.

The blocks template from the path "/" is loaded from the server and is updated based on the user's information saved in the real-time database on firebase. The authentication system listens for the login status for each page and decides to display different content based on user status.

Development environment:
1. JavaScript (jQuery libray)
2. Node.js (Express)
3. Firebase (Real-time Database, Authentication)
5. HTML, CSS 
6. Git
7. Linux ubuntu (VPN supported by Digitalocean.com)
8. Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code (editor)
