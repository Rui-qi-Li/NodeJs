# Blog website Project 

*This is a project for CS353C Software Design module, which will keep updating during the whole semester 

This is a reminder application website built on a remote server and run on Node.js for the server side language. Express is required to handle the requests from browsers, Google firebase is used for the real-time database and authentication system, Gppgle Cloud is used for the storage for uploaded files and images. jQuery library is embedded to process the browser's behaviour, templates and Ajax function. Bootstrap and Propeller are imported as front-end frameworks to provide UI design supprot. 

The blocks html template is loaded from the server and updated based on the information saved in the real-time database and storage of Google firebase. The CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) functionality are implemented for each item and users can set the notification function on specified item to receive email or message in the future. The authentication system listens for the login status for each page and decides to display different content based on user status.
